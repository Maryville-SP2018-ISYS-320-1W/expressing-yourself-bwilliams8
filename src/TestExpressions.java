 	Your predicted values for the expressions
	1.8
		Correct
	2.11
		Correct
	3.12
		Correct
	4.Uncertain
		Answer is 4. I was uncertain as to how java would handle the % symbol.
	5.Uncertain
		Answer is 2. I was uncertain as to how java would handle the % symbol.
	6.11
		Correct.
	7.Error, as "2 + 2" would be a string. Alternatively, it would print 2 + 2 + 7.
		I had the right idea, but it actually was 2+234.
	8.Error, as " 2 + 2" would be a string. Alternatively, it would print 7 + 2 + 2.
		I had the right idea, but it actually was 7 2 + 2
 
 	After testing the expressions in the main method, indicate above if your predictions were correct.
